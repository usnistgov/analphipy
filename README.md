# `analphipy`

Utilities to perform metric analysis on fluid pair potentials.  The main features of `analphipy` as follows:


## Overview

`analphipy` is a python package to calculate metrics for classical models for pair potentials.  It provides a simple and extendable api for pair potentials creation.  Several routines to calculate metrics are included in the package.

## Features

- Pre-defined spherically symmetric potentials
- Simple interface to extended to user defined pair potentials
- Routines to calculate [Noro-Frenkel] effective parameters.
- Routines to calculate [Jensen-Shannon] divergence

## Status

This package is actively used by the author.  Please feel free to create a pull request for wanted features and suggestions!

## Quick start

Use one of the following to install `analphipy`

``` bash
pip install analphipy
```
